# Source-Mutable Geometry (.smg) files are formatted as a subset of YAML.
## Note: byref vs byval should determine tolerancing, or something similar.  "equal" being lazy, or "equal" meaning toleranced as such.  Equal vs equivalent?

asset global:

asset local:
    - node: &id####
        ## That reference is actually useful, because it allows you to specify when to implement the include.  Readback -> put them in a folder with a specific name?
        ## Should it be Boss-Extrude1: &Boss-Extrude1 and then type: extrusion?  or feature: & and then type: and name: ?
          ## Names (or would ID be better?) should be unique (could create separate solidworksname for back-compatibility)
          ## Vertical, horizontal, etc would probably be better defined in terms of reference geometry?
           ## What about putting the sketch before the extrusion?  That's the order they're usually created in!
           ##  How to deal with sketch1-> sketch2 -> feature1 -> feature2 and other atypical rollback orders?
